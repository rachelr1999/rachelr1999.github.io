								<b>Education:</b>
							I am a third year graduate student at the University of Connecticut currently studying protostellar variability and its impacts on stellar mass assembly and protostellar disks. 
							I got my undergraduate degree at Purdue University in 2021, where I completed research developing a novel method of determining distances to supernova remnant using absorption spectroscopy of 
							Gaia field stars. 
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b> 
							I am interested in star formation, particularly in protostellar variability, stellar mass assembly, and protoplanetary disk evolution. 
							I am also interested in observational time domain astronomy, specifically in supernovae and supernovae remnant morphology and energetics.

								<b>Modeling Protostellar Variability Using Monte Carlo Simulations</b><br>
								Evidence suggests that protostellar outbursts likely play a critical role in the stellar mass assembly process, 
								but the extent of this contribution is not well understood. We aim to determine the minimum far-IR survey parameters
								required to unambiguously confirm that variable accretion events dominate the stellar mass assembly process. We base 
								these findings on a toy model Monte Carlo simulation of an evolving protostellar cluster. The cluster is constructed 
								using Herschel 70μm flux data and aged using a standard Monte Carlo simulation. We observe the cluster at various
								epochs in the evolution process to conclude the fraction of protostars undergoing accretion outbursts. Based on 
								observations and our simulation specifications, we determine that observing a protostellar cluster of at least 2000 
								protostars for five years with a six month observing cadence is sufficient for determining the importance of protostellar 
								bursts in the stellar mass assembly process. Our work presents a simplistic approach to answering the question of stellar
								mass assembly that can provide a fiducial model to be built upon by implementing more complex assumptions.

								<b>Direct Supernova Remnant Distance Estimates Using Absorption Spectroscopy of Gaia Field Stars</b><br>
								Knowledge of the precise distance to a supernova remnant (SNR) is vital  to accurately characterize the age, physical scale,
								and energetics of the original supernova. Distance estimates of supernova remnants have most often been based on indirect 
								measurements of the morphological and kinematic properties of a remnant's gaseous filaments. Here, we present a direct method 
								that utilizes high resolution spectroscopy of field Gaia stars sensitive to potential Na I D and Ca II H & K absorption 
								features associated with the expanding shell of the remnant. Using spectral observations of multiple stars, it is possible 
								to recognize the distance at which a transition is observed between stars that exhibit absorption features and those that do
								not. This transition region demarcates the maximum distance at which the supernova is located. Using this method, we investigate
								the distances to 3C 58, the Crab Nebula, and Puppis A. An analysis of the high resolution echelle spectra taken with the WIYN 
								3.5m telescope and the NEID instrument as well as observations taken by the 8m Gemini South telescope using the newly commissioned
								GHOST instrument is presented for the stellar sources within the neighborhood of these remnants.

								Fischer, W. J., Battersby, C., Johnstone, D., <b>Lee, R.</b>, Sewiło., M., Beuther, H., Hasegawa, Y., Ginsburg, A., Pontoppidan, K.
								<p>
								Abstract: Evidence abounds that young stellar objects undergo luminous bursts of intense accretion that are short compared to the time it takes to form a star. 
									It remains unclear how much these events contribute to the main-sequence masses of the stars. We demonstrate the power of time-series far-infrared (far-IR)
									photometry to answer this question compared to similar observations at shorter and longer wavelengths. We start with model spectral energy distributions
									that have been fit to 86 Class 0 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds. The protostars sample a broad range of envelope densities, cavity geometries, and 
									viewing angles. We then increase the luminosity of each model by factors of 10, 50, and 100 and assess how these luminosity increases manifest in the form of 
									flux increases over wavelength ranges of interest. We find that the fractional change in the far-IR luminosity during a burst more closely traces the change in
									the accretion rate than photometric diagnostics at mid-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We also show that observations at far-IR and longer wavelengths 
									reliably track accretion changes without confusion from large, variable circumstellar and interstellar extinction that plague studies at shorter wavelengths. 
									We close by discussing the ability of a proposed far-IR surveyor for the 2030s to enable improvements in our understanding of the role of accretion bursts in mass assembly.

								Garretson, B., Milisavljevic, D., Reynolds, J., Surbrayan, B., Weil, K. E., Banovetz, J., <b>Lee, R.</b>
								<p>
								Abstract: Here we present a catalog of 12,993 photometrically-classified supernova-like light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility,
								along with candidate host galaxy associations. By training a random forest classifier on spectroscopically classified supernovae from 
								the Bright Transient Survey, we achieve an accuracy of 80% across four supernova classes resulting in a final data set of 8208 Type Ia,
								2080 Type II, 1985 Type Ib/c, and 720 SLSN. Our work represents a pathfinder effort to supply massive data sets of supernova light curves 
								with value-added information that can be used to enable population-scale modeling of explosion parameters and investigate host galaxy environments.
